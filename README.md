A Visual Studio code extension with rich support for working with the **[manim](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim)** framework, providing features such as video and image live previews, gallery-based code snippet catalogs, etc... with completely flexible configurations.

The extension assumes an installation of manim on `PATH`. Follow [this guide](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/installation.html) to install manim (if you haven't) and [this guide](#how-do-i-change-the-default-manim-executable-path) to set a custom path to the executable file.

## Quickstart

After the extension is installed, open the source file with the scene classes and press the <image src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rickaym/Manim-Sideview/master/assets/images/rotation.png" height="100%" width= "15px"> icon from the menu bar or use `Ctrl+'` `r` to immediately start rendering with a live preview!

_That's it, folks!_

If you have any questions or find any issues, create a GitHub issue [here](https://github.com/Rickaym/manim-sideview/issues/new), seek support through the extension
[development discord server](https://discord.gg/UmnzdPgn6g/) or you can ping `@Neo#1844` with a question
on the official manim community discord server.

## Rendering Scenes

<image src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rickaym/Manim-Sideview/master/assets/images/dark_logo.png" height="100%" width= "20px"></image> **We've looked at how to render a scene in quickstart, now how do work with multiple scenes?**

In any event, the extension creates a job tied to the source file to ensure persistence in scene names, and configurations right after it is rendered for the first time.

**Changing the scene name!**

Manim Sideview is made to render a single scene at any given moment recurrently. To hop from scene to scene, you'll have to explicitly change the scene name through:

1. Using the `Manim: Set A New SceneName` command through the command palette `Shift + Command + P (Mac)` / `Ctrl + Shift + P`.
2. Using the following default hotkey `Ctrl + '` `c`.
3. Using the render-change icon from the sideview

## Configuring

<image src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rickaym/Manim-Sideview/master/assets/images/dark_logo.png" height="100%" width= "20px"></image>
There are two main ways to configure your render using
manim-sideview:

1. `manim-sideview.commandLineArgs`

By setting this configuration through `File -> Preferences -> Settings` you can pass CLI arguments to the `manim.exe` call.

2. `manim.cfg` file

If you're using a configuration file for your renders, worry not! the extension recognizes any manim configuration under the guideline [manim.cfg](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/guides/configuration.html#the-config-files) that exists
in the current working directory.

If a `manim.cfg` file is found, all command line arguments given through
`manim-sideview.commandLineArgs` is ignored.

## Mobject Gallery

The Mobject gallery is a web view that allows users to insert code snippets for commonly used manim objects, like squares, text, and also complex graphs.

### How do I open the gallery?

1. Open the command palette using `Shift + Command + P (Mac)` / `Ctrl + Shift + P`
2. Use the command `Manim: Open Mobject Gallery`

You can place the cursor at the desired location and click the image of the manim object to insert the code into a Python file or Jupyter Notebook!

## Frequently Asked Questions

1. [How do I render on save?](#1-how-do-i-render-on-save)
2. [How do I change the default manim executable path?](#2-how-do-i-change-the-default-manim-executable-path)
3. [How do I execute a command after the rendering is finished?](#3-how-do-i-execute-a-command-after-the-rendering-is-finished)

### 1. How do I render on save?

Enable the `manim-sideview.runOnSave` settings inside vscode `File -> Preferences -> Settings` menu.

<image src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rickaym/Manim-Sideview/master/images/settings_runonsave.png"></image>

### 2. How do I change the default manim executable path?

You can set the default manim executable path by changing the `manim-sideview.defaultManimPath` configuration in `File -> Preferences -> Settings`.

<image src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rickaym/Manim-Sideview/master/images/settings_defaultmanimpath.png"></image>

### 3. How do I execute a command after the rendering is finished?

We can achieve this via the extension preference `manim-sideview.terminalCommand` that accepts a command string.

<image src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rickaym/Manim-Sideview/master/images/settings_terminalcommand.png"></image>

The command is executed in an external terminal as soon as all the rendering is finished.

You can use the following variables in your terminal command:

1. `{outputPath}` - the path to the rendered media output (video/image)
2. `{sourcePath}` - the path to the source file
3. `{sceneName}` - the name of the scene rendered
